##[1.0] Ewald branch - 12/14/2015
+ Interation implementation (brute force) of NVT calculation on GPU is created and tested; however, there is still space to get the performance imporved.
? The cell-list implementation is still in trouble with water molecule test case because there are more than max number of molecules allowed in one cell.

## [1.7] - 04/14/2016
- Remove cudaMalloc and cudaFree from iteration and put them into class. Therefore, API calls will not be run in every step, which is very expensive. Performance is 3X than before.

## [1.7] - 04/13/2016
+ previous cell list GPU implementation is abondoned. The new GPU implementation runs only Reciprocal energy calculations on GPU.
+ Initialization of reciprocal on GPU is done.
+ Displacement and rotation moves are completed.

## [1.0] - 10/18/2015
+ Changes for input file system.
+ Added Cell list optimization to the GPU and the Serial code.

## [0.972] - 5/11/2015
+ Fixes for PDB output for NVT in the GPU code.

## [0.971] - 5/6/2015
+ Added missing CMAKE files for GOMC serial.
+ Updates to the test systems to be compatible with the new input formats.

## [0.97] - 4/11/2015

+ Added support for grand canonical ensemble.
+ Fixed calculation of angular weights for branched molecules coupled-decoupled configuration bias algorithm.
+ Improved move adjustments for better targeting of desired acceptance rate.
+ Various minor bug fixes for fringe conditions.
+ Improvements to I/O handling, inclusion of new output types relating to grand canonical ensemble (fluctuations, energy/particle samples, and distribution of molecule counts).
